**St. Damian Portal — Digitizing Dignity for St. Damian School**

## 🏫 Project Overview
St. Damian Portal is a sponsor-centric digital portal designed to capture, preserve, and present pupil information with
clarity, dignity, and emotional resonance. Built for St. Damian Nursery and Primary School in Amandugba, Nigeria, it
addresses a critical gap: the absence of a reliable system for storing and sharing pupil data. In many African communities, stories go untold—not 
because they lack meaning, but because they’re never recorded. St. Damian Portal ensures that every child’s name, village, and dreams 
are honored and visible to those who support them.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Digitize pupil records: names, grades, term results, and personal details stored securely
- Generate sponsor-friendly reports: visually dignified PDFs with school branding and emotional tone
- Enable ethical transparency: sponsors see the real impact of their support
- Preserve legacy: every child’s story becomes part of a lasting digital archive
